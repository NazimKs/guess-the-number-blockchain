# Guess The Number - Version 2

This is an enhanced version of the blockchain-based "Guess the Number" game, now with stakes involved.

## How It Works

1. **Player A**:
    - Provides a number to guess, the maximum number of attempts, and a stake (amount of cryptocurrency).
    - Deploys a smart contract with these inputs.

2. **Player B**:
    - Enters the smart contract address.
    - Places their stake (equal to Player A's stake) and starts guessing the number.

## Winning Conditions
- If Player B guesses the number correctly within the allowed attempts, they win and receive both stakes.
- If Player B fails to guess the number, Player A wins and takes both stakes.

Enjoy the game with higher stakes!
